Gasses are compressable; solids are not.
Gases have a high kinetic energy.

### Gas Laws
#### Charle's law:
If the volume increases, the temperature increases. Likewise if the temperature increases, so does the volume.

Formula: `p ∝ 1/T || (V,m)`

---
### Boyle's law
For a fixed amount of an ideal gas kept at a fixed temperature, P (pressure) and V (volume) are inversely proportional.

Formula: `P1V1 = P2V2`

Inclusion of state
`PV = nRT`
>R = 8.31 moles per K
>n = number of moles

## Specific Heat formulas
`Q = ∆u - W || by the system`
`Q = ∆u + W || on the system`
>Q = amount of heat energy applied to the substance
>u = internal temperature
>W = Work

`W = F*s`
>s = distnace

`P = F/A`
>A = area
>P = pressure

∴ `F = P * A`

`W = P*A*S` = `P*A*∆S`
∴ `W = PV`
>V: because A*S = _volume_

any `W = P∆V`

∴ `Q = ∆u - P∆V || by the system`

`W = P∆V` = `P (Vf - Vi)`

Words to learn are
* isochoric process: Work is 0
* isovolumetric: Volume is constant
* isothermal: Temperature is constant
* 0 point energy: at 0 K, a body has an internal energy of 0. something
* adiabatic: Q is 0
